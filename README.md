I started this project in 2023 but lost motivation soon. While my code is a bit messy, I figured I’d upload it—maybe someone will find it useful! If that’s you, feel free to reach out—I’d love to see what cool things you create. (Yea i know it's not the best game and does't look great)

I designed the game system to be as flexible as possible. In some cases, adding new features or content takes just a few seconds!

Here are some screenshots of the game:
